This a simple program on how an old encryption works when there used to be a two way conerstation and the sender didn't wanted the message to be read by other , so basically the people used to disscuss on how many shift they wanted to shuft the letter .
this code works by shifting the alphabets with the shift value :
for example : the sender enter the message : hello world
and the shift key is :5
so here the each letter in a message get a new alphabet which is 
new alphabet= alphabet + shift value
